This Java-based Caf√© Menu Ordering System allows users to browse and order from categorized menu sections such as Hot Coffee, Cold Drinks, Iced Tea, and Bakery items. Customers can select item sizes, quantities, and receive a full receipt detailing the subtotal, 13% tax (HST), and total. The system supports dynamic user input, including a universal "done" command to complete an order from any point. It generates timestamped receipts saved to local files for recordkeeping. The program uses object-oriented design and includes robust input validation, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly ordering experience via the terminal.
